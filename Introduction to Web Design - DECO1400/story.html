        After the letter came through the chimney, uncle Vernon told everyone to pack up their stuff and then they drove
        for long hours and once they finally have arrived they found out that uncle Vernon had rented a small house that
        appeared to be a shack that was on an island. They got on a small boat in a row to get to the house.

        However, it didn’t stop the letters. And one day, a giant called Hagrid knocked on the door asking for Harry to
        deliver the letter personally.

        Hagrid explained to that he’s a wizard just like his parents. And he was sent to the Dursley House when he was a

        After they got there, Harry found out that he’s popular because the wizard who killed his parents couldn’t kill
        Harry and he disappeared for a mysterious reason. After Harry got all the supplies he needed, he went to
