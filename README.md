# UQ Software Development Showcase for Student Developer Job Position
First of all, thank you for considering my application for the rule, I hope you find my work competent and sufficient.

I have decided to include three samples of my work from different areas to better demonstrate my skills. Below are small introductions to each sample and you can find the complete work on each corresponding folder.

Thank you.


## Sample 01: Python Desktop Application
### __Description__

This was my contribution to my ENGG4810 team project. This application
was made in Python and used to communicate with firmware to receive data
and plot them in real time. And storing, loading log files and applying
mask testing on the plot.

## Sample 02: Web Development
### __Description__

This was my Assignment One for Web Information Systems (INFS3202).
It was a rather small assignment meant to be an introduction to gain knowledge
in web evelopment but I have decided to include it here
since it is relevant to the position I am applying for. In the second
assignment. we implemented much more complex web application but it was
 a group assignment.
